# AI_Flappy_Bird
As the name suggest the AI plays the game flappy bird using NEAT algorithm. You can read about NEAT here: https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/neat_overview.html
This algorithm is very fast and chooses the best AI flappy birds for the next generation and eliminate others. It just takes 3-5 generations to find the best performing bird and that bird just plays this game endlessly without touching the pillars or falling down. The game itself is created with pygame library.
